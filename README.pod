=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements Dancer 2 session engine based on L<Sereal> files.

This backend can be used in single-machine production environments, but two
things should be kept in mind: The content of the session files is not
encrypted or protected in anyway and old session files should be purged by a
CRON job.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The setting B<session> should be set to C<Sereal> in order to use this session
engine in a Dancer2 application.

Files will be stored to the value of the setting C<session_dir>, whose default
value is C<appdir/sessions>.

Here is an example configuration that use this session engine and stores session
files in /tmp/dancer-sessions

    session: "Sereal"

    engines:
      session:
        Sereal:
          session_dir: "/tmp/dancer-sessions"
